# PE Toolset
## Overview
PE Toolset is an open-source project designed for Windows executable file manipulation. This project is implemented using Visual Studio, C++ and leverages the Win32 APIs. The primary function of this project is to allow users to view and edit the Portable Executable (PE) headers of any Windows executables and processes. Additionally, it provides functionalities such as DLL injection into running processes, and executable packing for protection against reverse engineering.

## Features
1. **View and Edit PE Headers**: This tool allows user to view and edit the PE headers of Windows executables or processes.

2. **DLL Injection**: This tool allows user to inject a DLL into Windows executables. 

3. **Executable Packing**: To protect your executables from being reverse engineered, you can pack them with this tool. It adds an extra layer of security, making the reverse engineering process significantly more difficult for attackers.
